# Digit Recongnition in C++
I have created a neural network from scratch, without using any libraries, in order to recognise handwritten digits.

## ðŸ¥« How does it work?
The actual sauce is in the file `ML.h`, where are located all the network classes. There are three main classes:
 - `Neuron`
 - `NeuralLayer`
 - `NeuralNetwork`

### Neuron
Each neuron contains a vector of the weights of his connection and a bias. The user can set the number of connections of the neuron and the activation function.
The main constructor of the neruon set the value of the weights and the bias using a random number (that goes from -0.5 to 0.5), generated by this formula: $$-0.5 + \frac{rand()}{RANDMAX}$$. Afterwards, there is the usual function which is used to calcuate the weight sum of the connections of the neruon.

### NeuralLayer
